## Overview
This project provides tools for reading, writing, and evaluating Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models.
The evaluation protocol consists of the following components:
- **Relative Pose Error**
- **Absolute Pose Error** *(in progress)*
- **Novel View Synthesis** *(in progress)*
- **3D Triangulation** *(in progress)*

## Installation
To set up the project, execute the following scripts:

### Step 1: Download the ETH3D Dataset
```bash
bash scripts/get_datasets.sh
```
This script will download the **ETH3D dataset** required for evaluation.

### Step 2: Clone Required Repositories
```bash
bash scripts/clone_repos.sh
```
This script will clone the following repositories:
- **GLOMAP**
- **VGGSfm**
- **Flowmap**
- **AceZero**

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Each cloned repository contains a README file with installation instructions.
Follow these steps for each method:
- Most methods require creating a virtual environment and installing dependencies using **conda** or **pip**.
- **GLOMAP** requires compilation or downloading precompiled binaries (Windows only).

To run the Novel View Synthesis evaluation, you need to install [NerfStudio](https://docs.nerf.studio/quickstart/installation.html)

## Evaluation Protocols

### Relative Pose Evaluation
The evaluation assesses **relative rotation error (RRE)** and **relative translation error (RTE)**, computed as follows:

#### Formulation
For each image pair \(i\) and \(j\):
```math
  R_{rel} = R_j \cdot R_i^T
```
```math
  t_{rel} = t_j - (R_{rel} \cdot t_i)
```
For implementation details, see [`relative_error_evaluation`](src/evaluation/relative_error_evaluation.py).

#### Running Relative Pose Evaluation
To evaluate relative camera poses, use:
```
python src/run_camera_poses.py --gt-model-path <PATH_TO_GT_MODEL> --est-model-path <PATH_TO_EST_MODEL>
```
- `<PATH_TO_GT_MODEL>`: Path to ground truth model (e.g., `data/ETH3D/courtyard/sparse/0`).
- `<PATH_TO_EST_MODEL>`: Path to estimated model (e.g., `data/results/glomap/ETH3D/courtyard/colmap/sparse/0`).

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** Files in `<PATH_TO_GT_MODEL>` and `<PATH_TO_EST_MODEL>` must be in **COLMAP format** (`.txt/.bin`).

### Absolute Pose Evaluation *(In Progress)*
ðŸš§ **This feature is still under development.** ðŸš§

An **absolute pose evaluation** script is currently in progress. See [`absolute_error_evaluation.py`](src/evaluation/absolute_error_evaluation.py).
- Uses the **Kabsch-Umeyama algorithm** to align estimated and ground truth camera poses.
- Computes **absolute rotation and translation errors**.

### Novel View Synthesis *(In Progress)*
ðŸš§ **This feature is still under development.** ðŸš§

This protocol evaluates the quality of **novel view synthesis** by comparing rendered images to ground truth images.
- **Nerfstudio** is used to generate novel views via **NeRF** or **Gaussian Splatting**.
- Evaluation is performed using **PSNR** and **SSIM**.

The script [`run_nerfstudio.py`](src/run_nerfstudio.py) only trains using either **nerfacto** or **splatfacto** methods.
The evaluation part will come later.

#### Running Novel View Synthesis
To train and evaluate novel view synthesis, use:
```
python src/run_nerfstudio.py --dataset-path <PATH_TO_SCENE_IMAGES> --results-path <PATH_TO_RESULTS> --method <METHOD>
```
- `<PATH_TO_SCENE_IMAGES>`: Path to dataset containing scene images.
- `<PATH_TO_RESULTS>`: Path to SfM method results (e.g., `data/results/glomap/ETH3D/courtyard/colmap/sparse/0`).
- `<METHOD> (Optional)`: Method to use for novel view synthesis (`nerfacto` or `splatfacto`). Default is `nerfacto`.

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** Files in `<PATH_TO_RESULTS>` must be in **COLMAP format** (`.txt/.bin`).

### 3D Triangulation Evaluation *(In Progress)*
ðŸš§ **This feature is still under development.** ðŸš§

This protocol evaluates the quality of 3D triangulation using the [ETH3D Multi-view evaluation tool](https://github.com/ETH3D/multi-view-evaluation).

The evaluation assesses the completeness and accuracy of the reconstructed 3D model compared to the ground truth.

#### Running 3D Triangulation Evaluation
To evaluate 3D triangulation, use:
```
python src/run_triangulation.py --ply_path <PATH_TO_RECONSTRUCTION_PLY> --mlp_path <PATH_TO_GROUND_TRUTH_MLP>
```

- `<PATH_TO_RECONSTRUCTION_PLY>`: Path to the reconstructed 3D model file (e.g., `data/results/glomap/ETH3D/courtyard/model.ply`).
- `<PATH_TO_GROUND_TRUTH_MLP>`: Path to the ground truth MLP file (e.g., `data/datasets/ETH3D/courtyard/dslr_scan_eval/scan_alignment.mlp`).

The evaluation results, including completeness, accuracy, and F1-scores, will be saved in `multiview_results.txt` in the same directory as the reconstruction PLY file.

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** This evaluation protocol is used for the **ETH3D dataset** as it requires the ground truth MLP file.

## Scripts

We provide scripts to run evaluations. However, those script expect the results to be stored in a specific directory structure.
If you decide to save your results in a different structure, you can create your own script or modify the provided scripts.

### Running Evaluation on All Results
To evaluate all **Relative Camera Poses** results, run:
```
bash scripts/camera_poses.sh
```

To evaluate all **Novel View Synthesis** results, run:
```
bash scripts/nerfstudio.sh <METHOD>
```
- `<METHOD> (Optional)`: Method to use for novel view synthesis (`nerfacto` or `splatfacto`). Default is `nerfacto`.

This script will take a long time to run, as it trains a model for each scene and evaluates it.

---
The scripts expect results stored in:
```
data/results/<method>/ETH3D/<scene>/colmap/sparse/0
```
For details, see the scripts in the [`scripts`](scripts) directory.

### Running Individual Evaluations
If you want to run an individual evaluation, see above [Evaluation Protocol](#evaluation-protocol)
