\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

In this section, we present the results of evaluating Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms using the metrics outlined in Section \ref{sec:methodology}. 
The results are divided into subsections corresponding to each implemented evaluation metric.

We assessed the accuracy of camera pose estimation using the Relative Rotation Error (RRE) and Relative Translation Error (RTE). 
The evaluation was conducted on \textbf{ETH3D} comprising multiple scenes with varying levels of complexity. 
The key results are summarized in Table \ref{tab:camera_pose_error}, with detailed analysis below.
