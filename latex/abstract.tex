\section*{Abstract}\label{sec:abstract}

Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques are integral in reconstructing 3D geometry from 2D image sequences.
Recent advancements in SfM have led to the development of several state-of-the-art algorithms that leverage deep learning and other modern techniques.
This report evaluates four contemporary SfM algorithms---\textbf{Glomap, VGGsfm, Flowmap,} and \textbf{Ace0}---on three diverse datasets:\textbf{ ETH3D, Tanks and Temples,} and \textbf{MipNeft360}. 
The evaluation focuses on critical metrics, including camera pose estimation accuracy, 3D reconstruction fidelity, and the quality of novel view synthesis.
The insights from this study aim to guide future development and application of SfM in computer vision and related fields.
