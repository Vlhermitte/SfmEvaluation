# Questions/Problems encountered

## Problems encountered
- Sometimes, the SFM pipeline fail to compute the camera pose for some images. 

## Questions
- Because I have missing cameras in the list of estimated cameras. 
  How can I evaluate the relative pose between two cameras if one or both camera are missing in the list of estimated cameras?
